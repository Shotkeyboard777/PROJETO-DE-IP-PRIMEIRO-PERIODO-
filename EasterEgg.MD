                         THE KEYBORD IS MY BODY AND COFFEINE IS MY BLOOD
                                I'VE TYPED OVE A THOUSAND LINES
                                        UNKNOWN TO C
                                    NOR KNOWN TO ASSEMBLY
                            HAVE WITHSTOOD THE PAIN TO WRITE MANY CODES
                            STILL THESE IDE'S WILL NOT COMPILE ANYTHING
                                AS I PRAY, UNLIMITED CODE WORKS."
